## [Wine Quality Analysis](https://github.com/yoons12055/Data-Analysis-ML-Python-Projects/tree/main/Wine%20Quality%20Analysis)
**Python(NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, GridSearchCV), Machine Learning Models(OLS, Ridge, Lasso)**
- Dataset of wine quality and other features was given in the course
- Compared R-squared, mean squared error, and mean absolute error of ordinary least squares(OLS), lasso, and ridge regression models
- Predicted wine quality with a model with the highest accuracy of out of sample R-squared
- University of California, Berkeley / IND ENG 142 Final Project

## [Predictions on University of California Basketball Scores](https://github.com/yoons12055/Data-Analysis-ML-Python-Projects/tree/main/UC%20Basketball%20Scores)
**Python(NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, OneHotEncoder, GridSearchCV, and KFold), Machine Learning Models(OLS, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Lasso, and Ridge)**
- Datasets of University of Calfornia Basketball Players' Stats from the UC schoolsâ€™ websites(Berkeley, LA, Davis, San Diego, and Irvine)
- Compared the R-squared, MSE, and MAE of ML regression models: ordinary least squares(OLS), decision tree, lasso, ridge, and random forest
- Predicted points scored for the next season from the other stats with the model with the highest accuracy
- University of California, Berkeley / IND ENG 142 Final Project

## [Predictions on the Confirmed and Death COVID-19 Cases](https://github.com/yoons12055/Data-Analysis-ML-Python-Projects/tree/main/COVID19%20Analysis%20Project)
**Python(Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn)**
- Datasets of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths of the United States were given in the course
- Constructed the best linear regression model
- Predicted the number of confirmed and death cases
- Investigated which factors contribute to predicting the number of deaths and confirmed cases
- **University of California, Berkeley - Data 100 Final Project**
