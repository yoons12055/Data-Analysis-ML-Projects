## 1. Wine Quality Project
**Python(NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, GridSearchCV), Machine Learning Models(OLS Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression)**
- Dataset of wine quality and other features was given
- Compared R-squared, mean squared error, and mean absolute error of ordinary least squares(OLS), lasso, and ridge regression models
- Predicted wine quality with a model with the highest accuracy of out of sample R-squared
- University of California, Berkeley / IND ENG 142 Final Project
